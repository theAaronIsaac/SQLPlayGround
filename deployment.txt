# SQL Playground - Deployment Instructions

This document explains how to deploy and run the SQL Playground application.

## Option 1: Simple Deployment (No Build Required)

This application is designed to be run without any build tools. You can deploy it with these simple steps:

### Requirements
- A basic web server (or Node.js)

### Steps

1. **Download all project files** and maintain the following structure:
   ```
   sql-playground/
   ├── index.html
   ├── App.js
   ├── SQLPlayground.js
   ├── index.js
   ├── style.css
   ├── package.json
   └── README.md
   ```

2. **Deploy to any web server**
   - Simply place all files in your web server's public directory
   - No compilation or build step is needed

3. **Alternatively, run locally using Node.js**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies (just the "serve" package)
   npm install
   
   # Start the local server
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000` (if using npm start)
   - Or go to the URL where you deployed the files

## Option 2: Using a Static Site Hosting Service

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push all the files to the repository
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings
4. The site will be available at `https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]/`

### Deploy to Netlify/Vercel

1. Create a new site from your Git repository
2. No build command needed - select to publish the directory as-is
3. Your site will be deployed to a Netlify/Vercel subdomain
